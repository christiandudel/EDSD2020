# Exercises

Below you find some (voluntary) exercises which you can solve. Questions regarding the exercises can be posted on Slack in #exercises.

## 1st session

1. Go to Slack and post some music you like to listen to while coding in #offtopic. If you prefer not to listen to music while coding you can post other music you like (e.g., videos on YouTube).
2. Install R and R Studio if you haven't done so already:
    * R https://cloud.r-project.org/
    * RStudio https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/ 
3. Create an R script using R Studio which runs the following calculations:
    * 1234+1234
    * 151/7
    * 13^4 - 12^3 + 5
    * 20/0
4. Create an R script using R Studio which, first, creates an object 'x' which contains the result of \sqrt{2}. Create a second object 'y' whch is equal to x^2. Finally, check whether x and y are equal using the == operator. Comment on the result (in the script file) - did you expect it?
